If user has supplied paths that appear to be leading to images, you should use this tool right away using Image mode. The behavior of this tool is determined by the `mode` parameter. The available modes are:\n- line: Show lines in a file, given by an optional `start_line` and optional `end_line`.\n- directory: List directory contents. Content is returned in the \"long format\" of ls (that is, `ls -la`).\n- search: Search for a pattern in a file. The pattern is a string. The matching is case insensitive.\n\nExample Usage:\n1. Read all lines from a file: command=\"line\", path=\"/path/to/file.txt\"\n2. Read the last 5 lines from a file: command=\"line\", path=\"/path/to/file.txt\", start_line=-5\n3. List the files in the home directory: command=\"line\", path=\"~\"\n4. Recursively list files in a directory to a max depth of 2: command=\"line\", path=\"/path/to/directory\", depth=2\n5. Search for all instances of \"test\" in a file: command=\"search\", path=\"/path/to/file.txt\", pattern=\"test\"\n",
